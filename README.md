With Terraform , I create two instances carts and mongodb 
(one is our application, the other is the database to which the application is connected)
Also I created two resourses such as Rules for the Firewall
I opened access to port 27017 - the port on which the Mongo DB database works 
and port 8081 - the port where our application works
